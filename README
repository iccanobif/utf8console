utf8console

DESCRIPTION: 

utf8console is a Python 3 package that makes it easy to enable a Python console application to print Unicode text under Microsoft Windows.
The idea is to change the terminal's codepage with the SetConsoleOutputCP() Winapi function at startup to cp65001 and force Python's stdout to use UTF-8.

USAGE:

simply add this line at the beginning of your source:

    import utf8console

That's it. From that point it's enough to use the built-in print() function to print unicode text.
